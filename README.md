# How does this project work?
This is a three wheeler controlled car which can be controlled by an android application “Easier Study” or a customed switch board provided by the institution where I finished my course. The prototype was developed using a mobile power bank for the power source and a USB data cable to connect. More, few basic components such as wheel, chassis, gear motor, and jumper were used in the car. But the principal instrument was easier pro board and easier switch board, which were from the course organization. This two worked as a chip and an alternative to the mobile application controller of the controlled car respectively. 
First of all, I have attached the easier pro board and a switch board on the chassis. Then had to connect a 6-pin JST jumper between these two components. There is a USB port on the easier pro to connect the USB cable to the power bank so it can generate power. On the other side of the chassis board, I attached two gear motors and a wheel with each of them. Also added a rotate wheel in front of two other wheels in a triangle-shaped position. Since have to connect the easier pro with gear motors so used two wires (with each motor) to connect them. Now if I just turn on the customed wireless connection and android application, I can control the three wheeler by moving the red color circle button. Simply if I move the circle to the front, the car will step to the front. Similarly, backside, right or left side or to rotate the car. Also, have to make sure that all the loads are on, on the easier pro board so that every load can work well.
